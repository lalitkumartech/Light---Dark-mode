        <h2>How to use Create react app to install React</h2>
        <h5>Hi I'm really new to react and I can't figure out
          how to actually install it or whatever it is I need to do to write code in it.

        <p>
          Hi I'm really new to react and I can't figure out how to actually install it or whatever it is I need to do to write code in it.
          I downloaded node.js and I have v12.18.3 installed as well as NPM 6.14.6 installed as well, but every time I try to type in the commands in the
          create-react-app installation method mentioned on many websites I get an error message saying: Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token.
          Am I supposed to be typing directly into node? I have Visual code studio installed am I supposed to use that in some way? I see thereâ€™s a github
          repository for create-react-app, does this mean I have to download it to my pc to run it? Does React just have a CDN I can use to skip all this?
        </p>
      </div>
       </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
